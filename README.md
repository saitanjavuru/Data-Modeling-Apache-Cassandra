# Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Udacity Data Engineering with AWS - Data Modeling Project

### Overview
In this project I modeled event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a fictional music streaming app called Sparkify. I defined queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.

### The Datasets
For this project, I worked with one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files are partitioned by date.
